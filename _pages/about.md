My name is Soli (Solomon) Vishkautsan, and since October 2017 I am a mathematics lecturer at [Tel-Hai Academic College, Israel](https://telhai.ac.il).
I am a senior lecturer, and the head of the mathematics unit at the college. I am a member of the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.telhai.ac.il/). 

My main topic of research is Arithmetic Dynamics, which is a blend of number theory, diophantine geometry and dynamical systems. 
In recent years I have also been researching non-commutative and non-associative algebras. 
Together with [Adam Chapman](https://sites.google.com/site/adamchapmanmain/), we have made first steps in looking at dynamics over division algebras, and have studied polynomial roots, eigenvalues and more in these algebras and the Cayley--Dickson algebras.

I am interested in mathematics programming, especially in Magma and sagemath, and hope to make more contributions in the future to the latter project. 


I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at:

- The [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de), under the supervision of [Michael Stoll](https://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/stoll/), supported by a fellowship from the [Minerva foundation](https://www.minerva.mpg.de), and [Fabrizio Catanese](https://www.mathe8.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/prof-fabrizio-catanese/index.php), supported by ERC project 340258 TADMICAMT.
- The [Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa](https://www.sns.it/en), under the supervision of [Umberto Zannier](https://people.sns.it/en/zanieru/), as part of the ERC-Advanced Grant *“Diophantine problems”*.
- In [Ben-Gurion University](https://bgu.ac.il), under [Dmitry Kerner](https://www.bgu.ac.il/staff-members-main-lobby/staffmemberslobby/kernerdm/) and [Ilya Tyomkin](https://math.bgu.ac.il/~tyomkin/).

I received my PhD in mathematics from Bar-Ilan University in June 2013. My PhD supervisors were [Boris Kunyavskii](https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~kunyav/) and Tatiana Bandman.

My name is Soli (Solomon) Vishkautsan, and since October 2017 I am a mathematics lecturer at [Tel-Hai Academic College, Israel](https://telhai.ac.il).
I am a senior lecturer, and the head of the mathematics unit at the college. I am a member of the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.telhai.ac.il/). 

My main topic of research is Arithmetic Dynamics, which is a blend of number theory, diophantine geometry and dynamical systems. 
In recent years I have also been researching non-commutative and non-associative algebras. 
Together with [Adam Chapman](https://sites.google.com/site/adamchapmanmain/), we have made first steps in looking at dynamics over division algebras, and have studied polynomial roots, eigenvalues and more in these algebras and the Cayley--Dickson algebras.


I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at:

- The [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de), under the supervision of Prof. [Michael Stoll](https://www.math.uni-bayreuth.de/en/stoll/index.html), supported by a fellowship from the [Minerva foundation](https://www.minerva.mpg.de).
- The [Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa](https://www.sns.it/en), under the supervision of Prof. [Umberto Zannier](https://people.sns.it/en/zanieru/), as part of the ERC-Advanced Grant *“Diophantine problems”*.
- In [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il), under [Dmitry Kerner](https://math.bgu.ac.il/~kernerd/) and [Ilya Tyomkin](https://math.bgu.ac.il/~tyomkin/).

I received my PhD in mathematics from Bar-Ilan University in June 2013. My PhD supervisors were [Prof. Boris Kunyavskii](https://math.biu.ac.il/en/node/1075) and [Prof. Tatiana Bandman](https://math.biu.ac.il/en/node/1074).
